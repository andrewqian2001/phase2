Factory design pattern:
LoginManager - when registering for a new user, the type of user is specified when registering and an instance of that specific user type is followed through


Dependency injection pattern:
Admin - contains a list of Report objects without instancing them
Trader - contains a list of Review objects without instancing them
TradingManager - request trade doesn't instance a new Trade object, it takes in a Trade object

Builder Design Pattern:
TradeBuilder - allows for the creation of a trade object in a step-by-step process.
