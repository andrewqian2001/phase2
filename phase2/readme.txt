1. initial admin:
username: admin
password: passssssssS11

2. Run the Main class in src -> main to run the program


TRADING PROCESS:
    1. Register a user, request items in the user & accept items in the admin

    2. Trade with other users (send trade requests).

    3. Have the other users accept/edit/deny trades.

    4. Confrim trades that are accepted (NOTE: temporary trades need to be confirmed twice, one for the first meeting and another time for
    the second)

    Some More notes:
        - Lending to one user does NOT count as that other user borrowing (or vice versa).
        - For a trade to count towards your borrows/lends, you must be the one who originally sent the trade request
          (i.e. some other trader editing a trade still makes it count towards the original trader's borrow/lend count,
          provided that it's still a borrow/lend)
