1. initial admin:
username: admin
password: password

2. Run the Main class in src -> main to run the program


TRADING PROCESS:
    1. Register a user, request items in the user & accept items in the admin

    2. Trade with other users (send trade requests).

    3. Accept/Edit trades (NOTE: you must accept your own trade that you requested).

    4. Confrim trades that are accepted (NOTE: temporary trades need to be confirmed twice, one for the first meeting and another time for
    the second)

    Some More notes:
        - Lending to one user does NOT count as that other user borrowing (or vice versa).
