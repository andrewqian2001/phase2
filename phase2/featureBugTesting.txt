Features:

Give the admin user the ability to undo every action taken by regular users that can reasonably be undone.

Have your program automatically suggest items to lend to a given user,
if there is something that is both on one person's wish list and the other's lending list.
In other words, when the user sees something they want to borrow,
they can ask the program for a suggestion of what they could lend this user in return.


Allow users to enter their home city when creating an account,
so that the system will only show them other users in the same city.

Have the automated trade suggestion always return the most reasonable trade, even if it's not an exact match.

Users can lend items, borrow items, or trade items.
However, they cannot borrow an item unless is it is part of a trade,
or they have lent more items than they have borrowed.
For example, everyone's first transaction must be lending, or trading.

After the transaction has occurred in real life, the user should
be able to log in and confirm that the transaction has been completed.
A transaction means a one-way or two-way trade. There is a limit on the
number of transactions any one person can conduct in one week, and a limit on how many
transactions can be incomplete before the account is frozen. An incomplete transaction is
one where two users agree to a one-way or two-way trade, but one of them does not show up.
Therefore, at least one person does not confirm to the program that the transaction occurred, because it did not.

In a previous paragraph, we said that a user must have lent (at least one) more item(s) than they have
borrowed, in order to make a non-lending transaction. However, the administrative user should be able
to change that to "at least two more items..." or "at least three..." etc.
