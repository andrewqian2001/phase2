Features:
 - LoginManager now automatically removes any invlaid trade requests for a trader on login
   (trades where the items offered are no longer in each trader's inventory).
 - Able to search for traders and items
 - Messaging between any two users
 - Get details about past trades (recently traded items, frequent traders)
 - Ratings for any trader
 - Automatic trade suggestions. Compares wishlist items and sees if there's a possible trade between users.
 - Another form of automatic trade suggestions (takes the item name and finds a good suggestion)
 - Every trader can input a city as their location (they start off in Toronto).
 - The ability to change username, password, and city as a trader
 - Password is validated so it has to meet certain requirements (certain length, needs upper case, needs symbol)
 - Idle status, a status that prevents you from trading and makes it so you don’t show up in the system as a trader.
   This can be toggled by the trader without admin approval as long as there are no ongoing trades
 - Reports, users can report another user (essentially just sending a message to the admins)
 - Demo user that can’t trade but can use the program like a trader, although none of the buttons that require an account
   actually work (such as sending messages, starting a trade)
 - Every admin can "infiltrade" a trader. This makes them take control of the account, allowing them to preform any actions
   that same trader could do. This gives the admin the ability to undo certain actions taken by the trader.
 - Every admin can undo an ongoing trade.
 - Ability for the admin to adjust trader limits (from inside or outside the program using trader.properties file)
